# TomatoBuild
I didn't want to learn make so I decided to just create my own build system cause why not :shrug:

It uses a json file for configuring all the tasks, rules and commands

You can look in the wiki for exact details on how to use this build system and it's features.

For an [example](https://github.com/Itay2805/TomatoBuild/wiki/Advanced-Example).
